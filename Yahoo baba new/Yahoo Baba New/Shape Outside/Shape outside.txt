Shape outside 

it is use with clip path 
and also use with text formatting 

why use it 
because when we place a circle image so the text we will want in same line 
problem is white space created a lot here 

cover with shape outside 

whitespace remove but another problem is text is with image 
im{
 float: left;
            clip-path: circle(30% at 30% 50%);
            shape-outside: circle(30% at 30% 50%);
           shape-margin:20px;
}
