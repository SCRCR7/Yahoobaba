CSS Grid Layout

The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.

Grid Elements
A grid layout consists of a parent element, with one or more child elements.

Display Property
An HTML element becomes a grid container when its display property is set to grid or inline-grid.

Grid Columns
The vertical lines of grid items are called columns.

grid-container {
  display: grid;
}

Example
.grid-container {
  display: inline-grid;
}


Grid Rows
The horizontal lines of grid items are called rows.

Grid Gaps
The spaces between each column/row are called gaps.

You can adjust the gap size by using one of the following properties:

column-gap
row-gap
gap






The gap property is a shorthand property for the row-gap and the column-gap properties:

.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  gap: 50px 100px;
}

The column-gap property sets the gap between the columns:

Shorthand

.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  column-gap: 50px;
}

Example
The row-gap property sets the gap between the rows:

.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  row-gap: 50px;
}


Grid Lines
The lines between columns are called column lines.

The lines between rows are called row lines.
