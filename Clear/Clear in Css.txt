CSS clear Values
left 
right 
both 

Design issue without clear 

Concept 
clear is use when data overlfow from left or right side 
for this problem we use clear:left proprty if left side data is massive 
otherwise we use clear:right property if it is data is massive from right side 
simple method is we use both if right and left both are massive data so it will be easy for us 

clear:both;
